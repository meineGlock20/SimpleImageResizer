# Simple Image Resizer

**Simple, fast, and free!**

Resize and convert images between these supported formats: BMP, GIF, JFIF, JPG, PNG, and TIFF. 

Three methods are availble; select your images, drag and drop your images, or batch an entire directory structure.

Simple mode allows quick resizing to small, medium, or large and outputs as the same image format.

Advanced output mode allows a choice of resizing by percentage, absolute, or aspect ratio. JPG quality can be adjusted. Can output to any other supported format.
